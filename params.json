Then it becomes quiet easier to develop and test at home some algorithm before loading them on the real robot with then only one possible point of failure : the designed CPU.\r\n\r\n## State\r\n\r\nThe V1.1 contains the following functionalities :\r\n - a MIPS CPU emulator with two implementations : C++ and python\r\n   - note : the C++ version is about 10times faster that the python version but is not avaible for windows so far\r\n - a robot with stepper motors\r\n - a memory area for sharing I/O between the robot and the CPU\r\n - a line sensor module plugged on the robot\r\n - a GUI in Qt where the user can trace lines and see the robot evolutes in\r\n - an editor inside the GUI to quickly write and test code on the robot\r\n","google":"UA-42073732-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
